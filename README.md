# **Quiz Game **

## **UX**

My Quiz game is a four-question quiz about Twins, I chose this particular subject because I myself is an identical Twin.

The Quiz game has multiple pages, which consist of a Home page, Play game page, How to play page and a final score page. Each page has a footer with social media links at the bottom connecting to my Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn.

I chose to design my Quiz like this based off research and found this to be a very user friendly and affective format.

The use of colours makes the game stand out and more importantly gives an indication of the correct and incorrect answer when choosing an answer.

The user can navigate back to the home page at anytime to start the game over again and also have the option of saving their score at the end of the Quiz.

The Quiz also has a how to page explaining how to play the game and how much each question is worth as a score.

This project will also be located on my portfolio website displaying my past, present and future projects.

**Wireframes**

I created my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for both mobile and desktop usage to display how the site will look.

**Features**

_Existing Features_

- Social media links - Each link opens a new page with the relevant social media page for the band (Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn). profiles from one place. The social media profiles load in a new tab, which allows users to then return to the site.

- Buttons - Allows users to navigate around my website by clicking each Button, which redirects them to the relevant page.

## **Technologies Used**

**Balsamiq**

I've used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

**HTML5**

The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.

**CSS3**

The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.

**JAVASCRIPT**

The project uses JAVASCRIPT to which programmes the behaviour of the website.

**Font Awesome**

The project uses Font Awesome for the social media links and icons used in my footer.

**Git**

I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to my project in VSCode, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub**

I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## **Testing**

_Responsive Testing_

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

**Challenges and Problems**

Due to time I was unable to get the users top scores to save correctly as some display as a random number

**HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT Validation**

I used the W3C HTML Validator tool to validate my HTML code.
I used the W3C CSS Validator tool to validate my CSS code.
I used Esprima Syntax Validator to validate my JAVASCRIPT code.

## **Deployment**

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my VSCode workspace.

2. Initialised Git using the git init command.

3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

4. Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit"command.

5. Created a new repository in GitHub called ‘quizgame’.

6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my VSCode workspace:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/PhillipSawyers/quizgame.git
   git push -u origin master

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.

8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project to Github.
