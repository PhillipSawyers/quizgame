# **Portfolio Project**

## **UX**

My portfolio website will be used by potential employers and future clients which will showcase my past, present and future projects.

The website has one page with multiple sections including a project section and a contact me section. The website also has links to my social media.

The user can contact me for more information via the contact me section of the website.

I've chosen to style my website in the way that I have, as I felt that it looks clean, clear and professional.

**Wireframes**

I created my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for both mobile and desktop usage to display how the site will look.

## **Technologies Used**

**Balsamiq**

**Git**

I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to my project in VSCode, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub**

I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## **Testing**

_Responsive Testing_

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

**Challenges and Problems**

I had and issue with my background image being responsive using different devices, I solved this problem using media query which allowed me to set adjustments to image based on the device it was displayed on

**HTML and CSS Validation**
